### :iphone: About the projects

#### [Easyfarm](https://github.com/Danilo-Js/My_Experience/blob/main/Easyfarm/english.md)

EasyFarm's mission is to organize all farm information in one place, making it possible to manage a farm in a complete, simple, and organized way.
This management is done through the modules: Agricultural Activity, Supply, Inventory, Maintenance, Service Orders, Purchases, and Rainfall.
There is also the generation of reports for each of the modules.
