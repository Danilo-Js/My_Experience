### :iphone: About the projects

#### Easyfarm

EasyFarm's mission is to organize all farm information in one place, making it possible to manage a farm in a complete, simple, and organized way.
This management is done through the modules: Agricultural Activity, Supply, Inventory, Maintenance, Service Orders, Purchases, and Rainfall.
There is also the generation of reports for each of the modules.

#### SCL

The Milk Control System is a tool made for the Brazilian Association of Girolando Breeders to manage their breeders, cows, and milk production.
This software belongs to the company Rerum.
